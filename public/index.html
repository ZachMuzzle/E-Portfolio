            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Zachary Muzzleman. I'm an inspiring software developer that loves to learn new technical skills
                and build software that peak my interests. I'm currently working as a associate software developer at Fulton Bank.
                Where I work in an agile methodology and work with team members to build automatons/integrations based on the project
                mangers needs. We look to help the bank by speeding up tasks and removing manual work by that the business completes
                this can lead to saving the bank money and time. The majority of the work I complete is building,testing, and deploying APIs,
                we use Postman to test APIs we build or to work with vendor APIs that we use withing our processes. I also work with gathering
                date from various databases using SQL Developer (Oracle) or SQL Management (SQL Server).
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a passion for building and learning new technologies and tech stacks that aim to help me become a more efficient developer
                for when I'm working or when I work on side projects. I would love to break into a more traditional developer/engineering role
                where I use traditional industry tech stacks and build relationships with co-workers that can help with advancing in my career.
